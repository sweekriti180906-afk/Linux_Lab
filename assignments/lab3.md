## Extra Questions

### Q1: What is the purpose of `#!/bin/bash` at the top of a script?

This is called a **shebang**. It tells the operating system to use the **Bash shell** to execute the script. Without it, the script might run with a different shell (like `sh`), which could cause unexpected behavior if the syntax isn't compatible.

---

### Q2: How do you make a script executable?

Use the `chmod` command to change the file's permissions. For example:

```bash
chmod +x scriptname.sh
```

This allows the script to be run like:

```bash
./scriptname.sh
```

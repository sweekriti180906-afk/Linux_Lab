## extra questions
# 1. What are two advantages of installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox?
two advantages of installing ubuntu in virtual box are:
1. Safe Testing Environment: You can try out Ubuntu without affecting your main operating system. If anything goes wrong, it won‚Äôt impact your primary system since Ubuntu is running inside a virtual machine.

2. Easy Snapshot and Rollback: VirtualBox allows you to take snapshots of your Ubuntu VM at different points. You can easily revert back to a previous state if you make a mistake or want to undo changes, which is very handy for experimentation and learning.

# 2. What are two advantages of dual booting instead of using a VM?
Two advantages of dual booting instead of using a VM are:

1. Better Performance: When you dual boot, the OS runs directly on the hardware without any virtualization overhead, so Ubuntu will generally run faster and have full access to your system‚Äôs resources like CPU, GPU, and RAM.

2. Full Hardware Access: Dual booting gives the OS direct access to all hardware components, including peripherals and advanced graphics features, which can be limited or slower in a virtual machine.
